**Summary of Discussion with Vishnu - Grafana Dashboard Enhancements**

**Date:** [Add date]
**Participants:** [Your Name], Vishnu

**1. Additional Aggregation Options in Grafana Dashboard**
- **Requirement:** Add extra options (e.g., `user_id`) to the "Aggregation By" dropdown in the Grafana dashboard
- **Implementation Path:**
  - Ensure required aggregation tags (like `user_id`) are properly configured in Cortex calls to Aquila
  - Aquila must pass these tags to J5V3 when provisioning AWS instances
  - Tags must be available as options in AWS Cost Explorer
  - Additional tags will be stored in the database when Cost Explorer data is persisted
  - PostgreSQL data source will supply the aggregated data to Grafana
  - Final result: `user_id` will appear as selectable option in "Aggregation By" dropdown

**2. Additional Visualization Types**
- **Current Status:** Time Series and other visualization formats are currently under development
- **Next Steps:** Vishnu's team will provide these enhanced visualization capabilities in future releases

**3. Automatic Email Notification Feature**
- **Feasibility:** This requirement can be implemented
- **Implementation Note:** Will not use Grafana's native notification mechanism
- **User Scope:** Limited to internal users only (Cortex Team employees)
- **Access Control:** Email notifications will respect the same permission boundaries as dashboard access

**Action Items:**
- [Your Team]: Provide specific tag requirements for aggregation
- [Vishnu's Team]: Implement the data pipeline changes and Grafana configuration
- Timeline and priority to be confirmed in follow-up discussion

Please let me know if you need any clarification or additional details.
