# Solution 1: AWS Cost Explorer API + Lambda + Grafana - Implementation Steps

## 1. Architecture Overview
```
AWS Resources → Cost Explorer API → Lambda → CloudWatch Metrics → Grafana
```

## 2. Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: IAM Role and Permission Configuration
- Create IAM role for Lambda function with necessary permissions:
  - `ce:GetCostAndUsage` - Access Cost Explorer API
  - `ce:GetCostForecast` - Optional cost prediction
  - `cloudwatch:PutMetricData` - Publish metrics to CloudWatch
  - Basic Lambda execution permissions

### Step 2: Lambda Function Deployment
- Create Python Lambda function (Python 3.9+ recommended)
- Package with boto3 library for AWS service interactions
- Configure environment variables:
  - `CLOUDWATCH_NAMESPACE`: "AWS/Cost" (custom metrics namespace)
  - Tag keys to monitor: Application, Environment, BatchId, CostCenter

### Step 3: Automated Trigger Configuration
- Set up CloudWatch Events (EventBridge) rule for automatic execution:
  - Schedule expression: `cron(0 2 * * ? *)` (daily at 02:00 UTC)
  - This timing ensures complete previous day's cost data availability
  - Automatic triggering - no manual intervention required

### Step 4: Data Collection Logic
- Lambda function executes daily and:
  - Calls Cost Explorer API with specified time range (previous day)
  - Groups cost data by configured tags (Application, BatchId, Environment)
  - Processes cost and usage metrics
  - Publishes structured data to CloudWatch Metrics

### Step 5: CloudWatch Metrics Structure
- Published metrics include:
  - **Metric Name**: "Cost"
  - **Dimensions**: Application, Environment, BatchId, TimePeriod
  - **Value**: Unblended cost amount
  - **Namespace**: "AWS/Cost" (custom)

### Step 6: Grafana Data Source Configuration
- Configure CloudWatch data source in Grafana:
  - Set up AWS authentication (IAM roles or access keys)
  - Specify default region
  - Configure custom metrics namespace: "AWS/Cost"

### Step 7: Grafana Dashboard Creation
- Build dashboards with panels for:
  - **Cost by Application**: Pie chart showing distribution
  - **Cost Trends Over Time**: Line graphs for historical analysis
  - **Batch-level Cost Monitoring**: Detailed batch task costing
  - **Environment Comparison**: Prod vs Staging vs Dev costs
- Configure auto-refresh intervals (e.g., 5-15 minutes)

### Step 8: Reporting and Alerting Setup
- **Weekly/Monthly Reports**:
  - Use Grafana reporting features (Enterprise) or API-based solutions
  - Schedule automated report generation and distribution
- **Alerts Configuration**:
  - Set up cost threshold alerts
  - Configure anomaly detection for unusual spending patterns
  - Integrate with Slack, Email, or PagerDuty for notifications

## 3. Key Configuration Details

### Tagging Strategy Requirements
- Ensure all AWS resources have consistent tags:
  - `Application`: Identify which application uses the resource
  - `Environment`: Distinguish prod/staging/dev environments
  - `BatchId`: Track specific batch job costs
  - `CostCenter`: For financial allocation and reporting

### Cost Explorer API Parameters
- Time granularity: Daily
- Metrics: UnblendedCost, UsageQuantity
- GroupBy: TAG keys (Application, Environment, BatchId)
- Time period: Previous full day

### Performance Optimization
- Lambda timeout: 5 minutes (adequate for daily cost collection)
- Memory: 256MB (sufficient for processing)
- CloudWatch metrics batch publishing for efficiency

## 4. Benefits of This Approach

### Real-time Monitoring
- Near real-time cost visibility (daily updates with potential for more frequent runs)
- Immediate insight into application-level spending
- Quick identification of cost anomalies

### Granular Cost Analysis
- Per-application cost tracking
- Batch job cost attribution
- Environment-specific cost comparison
- Historical trend analysis

### Automation and Scalability
- Fully automated data collection
- No manual intervention required
- Scales automatically with AWS usage
- Easy to modify tag-based grouping

## 5. Maintenance Considerations

### Regular Checks
- Verify Lambda function execution logs
- Monitor CloudWatch metric publication
- Validate tag consistency across resources
- Review and update IAM permissions as needed

### Cost Optimization
- Lambda function costs are minimal (daily execution)
- CloudWatch metrics costs scale with data points
- No additional infrastructure required

This solution provides a robust, automated approach to monitor and visualize AWS costs with application-level granularity, meeting all specified business requirements for live-ish data and comprehensive reporting.
