**Subject:** Update on My Work Plan for Next Week & Catchup Session Conflict  

Hi Jurrien,  

I hope this email finds you well.  

Due to the National Day holiday, I won’t be able to attend the catchup session scheduled for next Monday. I wanted to proactively share my work plan for the upcoming week to keep you updated.  

As discussed, our goal is to **automate the generation, storage, distribution, and analysis of detailed AWS cost and usage reports**. The solution aims to provide granular cost visibility—especially by application tags—with zero manual intervention for new applications, all built on the **Grafana platform**.  

Next week, my focus will be on **exploring and evaluating different approaches** to implement this solution effectively. This will include:  
1. Researching available tools and integrations (e.g., AWS Cost and Usage Reports, Athena, Grafana plugins).  
2. Investigating how to automate report generation and storage using AWS services.  
3. Exploring ways to visualize and analyze cost data by application tags in Grafana.  

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or additional requirements. I’m happy to adjust my plan based on your feedback.  

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!  

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
